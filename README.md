This project is my Final Year Project. It is a web-based Restaurant Recommender System using Collaborative Filtering and Content-Based Filtering techniques. This project is build by using Yelp Dataset. There are two models build to make recommendation to the user which are using Singular Vector Decomposition (SVD) for collaborative filtering and TF-IDF method for Content-based recommender system.

- The system can generate recommendations based on user similarity and user preferences. The recommendation is generated based on User ID. 
- User can view their information through dashboard
